Why do I love open source?

I love that people get together, globally and build things. I love that people help others in open source projects. I love that people are passionate about making something awesome, and at times, very useful, with other people.

Open Source facilitates the demolition of barriers, of all kinds. Open Source helps people make a difference in how we relate to each other.

Open Source helps us do better. Open Source helps us be better.
